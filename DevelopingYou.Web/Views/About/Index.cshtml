        <p class="ChaseWords">I am a laid back individual with an unappeasable wanderlust. I love mountains and large bodies of water, as well as music in the park and dancing in the rain. I grew up in a small town in northern Wisconsin where my parents own a bar and motel. Software development, I believe, is a great opportunity to be a part of an innovative and prosperous future.</p>

        <p class="StaceyWords">Greetings! My name is Stacey Teltser and I'm a Software Developer. I am a native of DC and moved to Iowa to pursue my BS at Coe. After graduating I worked as a Sign Language Interpreter for several years, where I was exposed to programming. That led me to learn basic Javascript and Python during my free time. It wasn't long after that I enrolled in DeltaV! I have enjoyed developing new skills, engaging in continuous problem solving, and learning new technologies. I look forward to collaborating with others to create and maintain software that positively impacts the lives of others.</p>

        <p class="FrancescoWords">
            Hello, my name is Francesco Troiano, I am a software developer with previous experience in the customer service industry. In previous jobs I had found my passion, which was for people. I enjoyed working with them, helping them develop, and watching them grow drove me to furthering my own self. In my drive to become a full stack developer I found that I could take my passion and apply it towards the wonderful world of coding, and I'm excited to do so at future opportunities.
