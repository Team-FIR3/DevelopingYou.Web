# Developing You Web Project
User interface web MVC application for midterm project.
![.NET Core](https://github.com/Team-FIR3/DevelopingYou.Web/workflows/.NET%20Core/badge.svg?branch=master)

## Problem Domain
A guided behavioral modification app that helps make the journey of achieving your personal goals more attainable, created with evidence-based approaches.

## User Experience
A user who is logged in will be shown their home page when loading this app, which will contain a visual depiction of their goal progress as well as form where they can log instances of the behavior they are trying to modify. A user can navigate to a Goals page to set a new goal (currently a user can only have one goal running at a time). When setting a new goal, the user will be asked to input the name of their goal, the current amount in which they engage in that behavior, their goal amount, what category their goal falls under, and what date they want to have completed their goal by. Upon creating their goal, the user will be returned to the Goals page where they can view the goal they are currently working on, the instances they've logged so far, and a visual breakdown of the user's progress. A user can update their goal at any time, delete their goal, as well as edit and delete an instance.
